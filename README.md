# A Gomoku Engine based on supervised learning using ResNet and SE Module
## Training data is generated by Katagomo gtp engine [Link](https://github.com/hzyhhzy/KataGo/releases/tag/20210520)
**This project is based on LibTorch so you need to prepare the environment manually ( including CUDA dlls )**
### There are three MCTS Bots in this engine
1. MCTS *A pure algorithm bot which do not use Neural Network*
3. MCTSVNN *A bot uses NN but only output value*
4. MCTSPVNN *A bot uses NN output both policy and value*
